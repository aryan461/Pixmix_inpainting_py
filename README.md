# Pixmix_inpainting_py
This is the image-based implementation of "High-Quality Real-Time Video Inpaintingwith PixMix" by Jan Herling.
This code is just the translation of @Mugichoko445's code and even the names are the same.



To do:

-Make the code parallel and faster.

-Inpainting for video(adding tracker).

-Some minor changes in the algorithm.
